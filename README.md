## Description

We have created an application that will take a user's chosen movie & give you a recommended game. 
We grab the genre of your favorite movie & compare them to a library of games and choose a game for you. 

## User Story 

Users will be presented with a "blank" page. 
Users have no data saved in local storage yet. 
Users will click the "button" to traverse to the search page
Users will click on the search bar and begin typing the characters of their desired movie! 
Once movie is found and clicked, the movie will display along with its release year, genre & plot. 
Users will then click the save and get recommendation button which will traverse back to the home page where you'll see your game and a recommended game! 
Hoping users find the same experience from their desired movie in the recommended game as well. 
Users can click the button again to go through the experience once more.
